Towards Interoperable Automation Engineering Mapping AutomationML to AAS Submodels

ðŸ“„ Overview
This repository contains the implementation and supplementary materials for the paper: "Towards Interoperable Automation Engineering: Mapping AutomationML to AAS Submodels". The project introduces a middleware solution that maps AutomationML (AML) project descriptions to Asset Administration Shell (AAS) submodels, particularly focusing on the Automation Engineering Submodel as defined by the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA).

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal of this project is to enhance interoperability in automation engineering by:

Analyzing the semantic structures of AML and AAS.

Mapping AML Component Descriptions to the Automation Engineering Submodel.

Implementing a middleware using the BaSyx Python SDK to perform this transformation.

Validating the approach with an industrial case study.

ðŸ§© Technologies Used
AutomationML (AML): XML-based format for data exchange in automation engineering.

Asset Administration Shell (AAS): Digital representation of assets following the Industry 4.0 paradigm.

BaSyx Python SDK: SDK provided by Eclipse BaSyx for working with AAS.

Python 3.9+
