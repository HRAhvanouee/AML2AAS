# ðŸ”— Towards Interoperable Automation Engineering  
**Mapping AutomationML to AAS Submodels**

## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository contains the implementation and supplementary materials for the paper:

**"Towards Interoperable Automation Engineering: Mapping AutomationML to AAS Submodels"**

The project introduces a middleware solution that maps **AutomationML (AML)** project descriptions to **Asset Administration Shell (AAS)** submodels, particularly focusing on the **Automation Engineering Submodel** as defined by the Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA).

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project is to enhance interoperability in automation engineering by:
- Analyzing the semantic structures of AML and AAS.
- Mapping AML Component Descriptions to the Automation Engineering Submodel.
- Implementing a middleware using the **BaSyx Python SDK** to perform this transformation.
- Validating the approach with an industrial case study.

## ðŸ§© Technologies Used

- **AutomationML (AML)**: XML-based format for data exchange in automation engineering.
- **Asset Administration Shell (AAS)**: Digital representation of assets following the Industry 4.0 paradigm.
- **BaSyx Python SDK**: SDK provided by Eclipse BaSyx for working with AAS.
- **Python 3.9+**

## ðŸ§ª Industrial Use Case

To validate our proposed mapping approach, we applied the middleware to a real-world automation project: the **VERA chemical pilot plant** (*Verfahrenstechnische Pilotanlage*), a modular process engineering test facility.

The **AML project of VERA**, based on standard AutomationML libraries, served as the input for our transformation. This pilot plant includes:

- 8 process tanks with distinct roles in the chemical workflow
- Over 70 sensors and 80 actuators
- A complex interconnecting piping system
- Standard industrial components from common automation suppliers

The 4 upper tanks of the plant serve as raw material reservoirs or intermediate storage units, feeding processes downstream. The rich structural data encoded in AMLâ€”including topology, component hierarchy, and connectivityâ€”was successfully translated into the **Automation Engineering Submodel** format using our middleware.

### âœ… Benefits Demonstrated:
- **Accurate semantic mapping** of AML elements to AAS submodel elements
- **Improved consistency** in representing component relationships and functions
- **Support for lifecycle-wide interoperability**, from design to operation
- **Reusability** of engineering data across tools and platforms
- **Compatibility** with AAS-based digital twin frameworks and APIs

This industrial case study proves the feasibility and practical value of our middleware solution, showcasing how AML-based projects can be enriched with AAS features such as security, multi-format support, and lifecycle integration.
